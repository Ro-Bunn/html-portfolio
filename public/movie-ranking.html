<h2>My Top 3 Books of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Throne of Glass by Sarah J Maas</h3>
<p>This young adult fantasy series excels well in 
   it's world building and makes you really care for it's each and individual character</p>

<h3>The Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros</h3>
<p>This Dragon Romantasy series has amazing world building, good amount of build-up and spice as well 
   as an addictive storyline that keeps you hooked.
</p>

<h3>Yours Truly by Abigail Jimenez</h3>
<p>This Contemporary Romance is everything you'll want in a romance. The main male 
   character is perfect but in his own imperfect way. The characters don't feel
   surface level like all the other contemporary romances out there
